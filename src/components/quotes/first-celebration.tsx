        In 1872, African Americans in Texas organized the first formal
        Juneteenth celebrations to honor their newly recognized freedom after
        the reading of General Order No. 3 in 1865.

        A group of formerly enslaved Black community leaders in Houston pooled
        $800 to purchase Emancipation Park, a dedicated space for Juneteenth
        gatherings and future celebrations.

      <Quote animationKey="highlight-3" variants={quotesItem}>
        The celebrations featured barbecues, prayer services, music, speeches,
        and games â€” reflecting a blend of African American traditions,
        resilience, and hope.

      <Quote animationKey="highlight-4" variants={quotesItem}>
        The 1872 gathering laid the foundation for Juneteenth to become an
        annual cultural and political tradition, even as Black Americans faced
        Reconstruction-era injustices.
