        The celebrations featured barbecues, prayer services, music, speeches,
        and games â€” reflecting a blend of African American traditions,
        resilience, and hope.

        The 1872 gathering laid the foundation for Juneteenth to become an
        annual cultural and political tradition, even as Black Americans faced
        Reconstruction-era injustices.
